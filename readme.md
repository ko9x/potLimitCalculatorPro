#Things to do
* Arrange the functions into groups 
* Arrange the properties into groups
* Add additional functionality to the player tracker
    * implement the actionOn class to follow who this action is on
    * implement the dealer class to follow who the dealer goes to next
    * include functionality to allow the user to add or remove players from the table
    * include the current bet a player has made in the players tracker bar
    * we need to skip the action to the next player wether the previous player checked, called, or folded
    * the action and dealer buttons need to skip players that have been removed and recycle to the top of the list
* Merge the sean and master branches once I am at a good spot and I am confident I can merge them correctly
* And probably a bunch more that I am forgetting at the moment
